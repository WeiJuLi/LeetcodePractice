## ðŸ“– Understand

### ðŸ“Œ Step-by-step Process:

- **Read the question out loud**.
- **Clarify the following details**:
 - _Can the input list be empty?_ Yes, it can be empty.
 - _Can the numbers in the array duplicate?_ Yes, definitely
 - _Can the numbers be positive, negative, or both?_ Both
 - _Is there any requirement on time/space complexity?_ Yes, Time O(n), Spcae O(n)
 - _Can I use Python to solve the problem or are there any languages you prefer me to use?_ Python is preferred
 - _Do you want me to write pseudocode first or just code the result out?_ I'll write pseudocode first

### Example Test Cases:

- **Happy Case:**

 ```python
 Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
 Output: true
 ```

- **Edge Case:**
 ```python
 Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
 Output: false
 ```

## Match

Identify suitable **Data Structures** or **Algorithms** if you're stuck.


 put every integer inside a set(), all elements inside this set() should be unique.
 We can check whether the length of the set and the length of the variable length are the same. If they are the same, then there's no duplicate integer inside this array. However, if they are different, then there must be duplicate integers in the input.

**Example Thought Process:**

## ðŸ”‘ Key Data Structure:



---

## Plan (Pseudocode)



---

## Implement (Write the actual code)



---

## Review

- Carefully review your implementation by checking:
 - Correctness of variable naming.
 - Constraints handling.
 - Edge cases coverage (negative numbers, duplicates, sorted order).

---

## Evaluate

- Time Complexity: 
- Space Complexity: 

---

## Optimize

## Evaluate (Self-assessment)

- Did I clearly understand the question and constraints?
- Was my solution efficient in terms of time and space?
- Did I consider edge cases and validate my solution adequately?
- Can my code readability or structure improve?
