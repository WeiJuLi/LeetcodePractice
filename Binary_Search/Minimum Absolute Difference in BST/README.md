## üìñ Understand

### üìå Step-by-step Process:

- **Read the question out loud**.
- **Clarify the following details**:
 - _Can the input list be empty?_ No, we will given a root.
 - _Can the numbers in the array duplicate?_ No. Every element should be distinct. Because by definition, a Binary Search Tree (BST) does not have duplicate values ‚Äî each node‚Äôs left child must have a strictly smaller value, and each right child must have a strictly greater value.
 - _Can the numbers be positive, negative, or both?_ Both
 - _Is there any requirement on time/space complexity?_ Yes, 
 - _Can I use Python to solve the problem or are there any languages you prefer me to use?_ Python is preferred
 - _Do you want me to write pseudocode first or just code the result out?_ I'll write pseudocode first

### Example Test Cases:

- **Happy Case:**
 ```python

 ```

- **Edge Case:**
 ```python

## Match

Identify suitable **Data Structures** or **Algorithms** if you're stuck.

### Why DFS??
In a BST, in-order DFS gives values in sorted order.
Once the values are sorted, we only need to compare adjacent values to find the smallest difference.
DFS (especially in-order) helps us visit nodes in order from smallest to largest.

### Why not BFS??
BFS goes level by level.
The values are not sorted in BFS order.
So we would have to collect all values, sort them, and then compare ‚Äî which takes extra time and memory.

BST has a special property: in-order traversal gives sorted values.
We can just do in-order traversal and compare adjacent values to get the minimum difference.

To implement this, we can use:

1. Iteration : More memory-efficient and no stack overflow problem 
2. Recursion : Can cause stack overflow if recursion depth is too deep (e.g., very unbalanced trees)

Which one is better?

1. ÂÖàleft (middle‰πüÂ±¨Êñºleft)
2. Ë®àÁÆóminDiff
3. ÂÜçright 

### DFS Resursion 
Set prev as None and minDiff as infinity

Define a recursive inorder(node) function:

If node is None, return

Recursively call inorder(node.left)

If prev is not None, update minDiff = min(minDiff, node.val - prev)

Set prev = node.val

Recursively call inorder(node.right)

Call inorder(root)

Return minDiff

### DFS Iteration 

![photo](https://github.com/WeiJuLi/LeetcodePractice/blob/main/Binary_Search/Minimum Absolute Difference in BST/DFS_iter.jpg)

Initialize variables:

cur as the root node (current node pointer)
stack as an empty list (to simulate recursion for in-order traversal)
minDiff as a large number (e.g., 100000) to store the minimum difference
prev as a very small number (e.g., -100000) to store the previous node's value during traversal

While stack is not empty or cur is not null:

While cur is not null:

Push cur onto the stack

Move cur to its left child

Pop a node from the stack, assign it to node

Update minDiff as the minimum of minDiff and (node.val - prev)

Update prev to node.val

Move cur to the right child of node

After traversal, return minDiff as the result

# Solution

## Review

- Carefully review your implementation by checking:
 - Correctness of variable naming.
 - Constraints handling.
 - Edge cases coverage (negative numbers, duplicates, sorted order).

---

## Evaluate

- Time Complexity: O(logn)
- Space Complexity: O(n)

---

## Optimize

---

## Evaluate (Self-assessment)

- Did I clearly understand the question and constraints?
- Was my solution efficient in terms of time and space?
- Did I consider edge cases and validate my solution adequately?
- Can my code readability or structure improve?
